# Remotion Video Pipeline

**Platforms:** Claude · Openclaw · Codex
**Domain:** Video

## Purpose

A production-director playbook for short-form Remotion videos. It standardizes an
**audio-driven** workflow so every video follows the same process and no step
cascades into rework. It orchestrates and gates the pipeline; it delegates the
actual Remotion composition code to the `remotion-best-practices` skill.

The governing principle:

```
音频 = 主时间轴   (audio = master timeline)
SRT  = 时间标尺   (SRT  = time ruler)
Remotion = 画面生成器  (Remotion = visuals generator)
CapCut   = 声音/最终剪辑 (CapCut = sound + final edit)
```

## When to Use

- When you want to produce a Remotion knowledge/explainer 短视频 with narration
  and on-screen subtitles
- When you want a repeatable script → audio → SRT → timeline → render → CapCut
  process instead of an ad-hoc one
- When you need the AI to recalibrate scene timing from real audio without
  rewriting the locked script
- When you want a structured `scenes.json` to drive Remotion instead of
  hand-editing composition code

## The Pipeline

```
1. AI: script + on-screen text + initial storyboard
   └─ 🚦 GATE 1: human confirms the script   (script is now LOCKED)
2. Audio: AI TTS or self-recording            (audio = master timeline)
3. SRT generated from the FINAL audio (Whisper default)   (SRT = time ruler)
4. AI recalibrates the timeline from the SRT — NEVER rewrites the script
   └─ 🚦 GATE 2: human confirms the timeline   (before any render)
5. AI emits scenes.json / timeline (structured data, not hand-edited code)
6. Remotion renders visuals + key subtitles + narration
   (composition code delegated to remotion-best-practices)
7. Handoff bundle → CapCut
8. CapCut: BGM / SFX / transitions / final polish   (manual; checklist only)
```

Two mandatory STOP gates (Steps 1 and 4) protect the most expensive rework
points. Audio approval (Step 2) and a pre-render preview (Step 6) are optional
recommended checks.

## Scope & Boundaries

- Remotion short-video pipelines only — not general video editing or other
  renderers.
- Tool-agnostic: audio via any TTS or self-recording; SRT via any speech-to-text
  (Whisper is the documented default). Nothing is hard-required.
- Defers composition code and rendering to the `remotion-best-practices` skill.
- Writes only the project's `scenes.json`/timeline and its asset folder, and
  confirms before overwriting existing files. Handles no credentials.
